# Dog-API

## Description
Dog API. Use the Dog API to fetch random images of dogs or you could even fetch specific breeds. We perform basic requests using URLSession to gather and pass data. Everything from the
API and the Codable struct to our View.

This is iOS networking and we perform network requests to fetch data from an API.
